# Insert items into a List Given an Index

The inspiration of this problem came from a post on the Elixir forum:

https://elixirforum.com/t/enum-over-list-and-insert-items-from-another-list-at-certain-indexes/50263

## Indexes are Relative to the Given List

## Indexes are Relative to the Resultant List
