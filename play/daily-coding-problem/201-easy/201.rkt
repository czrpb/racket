#lang racket

; =========================================
; Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

; This problem was asked by Google.

; You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle
; of numbers. For example, [[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]] represents the triangle:

;   1
;  2 3
; 1 5 1

; We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent
; value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of
; the path is the sum of the entries.

; Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.
; =========================================

(define (wrap-with-0s l) (append (cons 'zero l) (list 'zero)))

(define (pairs l)
  (for/list [(a (drop-right l 1)) (b (drop l 1))]
    (list a b)
    )
  )

(define test1 '((1) (2 3) (1 5 1)))
;(define test1 '((2 3) (1 5 1)))

(apply max
 (foldl
  (Î» (l1 l2)
    (let [(l2-pairs (pairs (wrap-with-0s l2)))]
      (flatten
       (for/list [(i1 l1) (i2 l2-pairs)]
         (match i2
           [(list 'zero a) (+ i1 a)]
           [(list a 'zero) (+ i1 a)]
           [(list a b) (list (+ i1 a) (+ i1 b))]
           )
         )
